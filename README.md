# NYPD Crime Analysis Project

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of crime patterns in New York City using publicly available NYPD crime data. The analysis combines statistical methods, geospatial visualization, and natural language processing to provide a multidimensional understanding of crime distribution and patterns across NYC's five boroughs.

## Key Features

### üèòÔ∏è **Borough-Level Analysis**
- Crime distribution comparison across all five NYC boroughs
- Correlation analysis with socio-economic factors (population density, median household income)
- Infrastructure impact assessment (police precinct distribution)
- Combined bar and line chart visualizations
- Correlation heatmap for identifying significant associations

### üë• **Demographic Analysis**
- Victim gender distribution patterns
- Age group vulnerability assessment
- Population-based crime impact analysis

### üìÖ **Temporal Pattern Analysis**
- Monthly crime frequency trends
- Day-of-week patterns and cyclical behaviors
- Seasonal trend identification for law enforcement planning

### üó∫Ô∏è **Geospatial Visualization**
- Interactive crime hotspot mapping using Folium
- City-wide crime density visualization
- High-risk zone identification across NYC

### üî§ **Natural Language Processing**
- Advanced text preprocessing of crime descriptions
- Sentence embedding generation for semantic analysis
- Feature extraction from unstructured crime data
- DBSCAN clustering for crime type categorization
- Textual similarity-based incident grouping

## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Core programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Statistical visualization
- **Folium** - Interactive geospatial mapping
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms (DBSCAN clustering)
- **NLTK/spaCy** - Natural language processing
- **Sentence Transformers** - Text embedding generation

## Data Sources

- **Primary**: NYPD publicly available crime data
- **Secondary**: NYC demographic and socio-economic indicators
- **Infrastructure**: Police precinct location data

## Analysis Components

### 1. Statistical Analysis
- Descriptive statistics of crime patterns
- Cross-borough comparative analysis
- Correlation analysis between crime and socio-economic factors

### 2. Visualization Dashboard
- Multi-dimensional chart representations
- Interactive maps for spatial analysis
- Trend analysis over time periods

### 3. Machine Learning Applications
- Unsupervised clustering of crime incidents
- Text similarity analysis for crime categorization
- Pattern recognition in crime descriptions

## Key Insights

The analysis reveals:
- **Spatial Patterns**: Identification of high-crime density areas across NYC
- **Demographic Trends**: Vulnerable population groups and targeted crime types
- **Temporal Cycles**: Peak crime periods and seasonal variations
- **Textual Clusters**: Common crime description patterns and incident types
- **Socio-economic Correlations**: Relationship between crime rates and borough characteristics

## Applications

This analysis supports:
- **Data-driven Policy Making**: Evidence-based crime prevention strategies
- **Targeted Policing**: Resource allocation based on hotspot identification
- **Public Safety Initiatives**: Community awareness and protection programs
- **Urban Planning**: Infrastructure development informed by crime patterns
- **Academic Research**: Comprehensive crime pattern studies
